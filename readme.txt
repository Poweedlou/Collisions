make compile in build directory makes host.exe
use host.exe to make moleculas.bin
use gui2.py to watch moleculas.bin
choice without a choice:
1) only 2d - 3d only for statistics, which are not implemented :D
2) only if double allowed - idk what does this mean
3) only odd molecules number - somehow causes memory leak
4) no funny stuff
5) make sure to have kernels in program folder (*.cl)
6) you may want to build in separate /build/build folder
